## Project Title: NFC PCB Business Card

### Project Description:

Welcome to the NFC PCB Business Card project! This project aims to provide a template and resources for creating your own NFC-enabled business card using a printed circuit board (PCB). NFC technology allows for seamless communication and data exchange between devices, making it an ideal choice for modern business cards.

### Features:

**NFC Communication:** The business card utilizes NFC technology to enable communication with NFC-enabled devices such as smartphones and tablets.

**Customizable Design:** The PCB layout and design files are provided in the repository, allowing for easy customization to suit your personal or business branding.

**Embedded Information:** Easily embed your contact information, website URL, portfolio links, or any other relevant data onto the business card for convenient sharing.

### Repository Contents:

**PCB Design Files:** Includes schematic diagrams and PCB layout files (e.g., Gerber files) for manufacturing the NFC PCB business card.

**Bill of Materials (BOM):** A list of components required to assemble the business card, along with part numbers and suppliers.

### How to Use:

**Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning or downloading the repository to your local machine.

**Customize the Design:** Modify the PCB design files using your preferred PCB design software, adjusting the layout, dimensions, and artwork to match your branding.

**Manufacture the PCB:** Use the provided Gerber files to manufacture the NFC PCB business card. You can choose your preferred PCB manufacturer or fabrication service.

**Assemble the Business Card:** Follow the assembly instructions to solder the components onto the PCB and assemble the business card.

### Contributing:

Contributions to the project are welcome! Whether you've discovered a bug, want to suggest an improvement, or have created your own variation of the business card, feel free to submit pull requests or open issues on GitHub.

I hope this project inspires you to explore the possibilities of NFC technology and create innovative solutions for networking and information sharing. Happy building!
